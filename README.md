`git clone https://github.com/marcsze/swc_introR_lessonStuff.git`

### Intro to RStudio

When we open up RStudio there are three panels the immediately appear
* The Console
* Environment/History (where you can see the data you load)

You can run commands directly on the console like you would in the `bash` command line.

```R
print("Hello World")
```
